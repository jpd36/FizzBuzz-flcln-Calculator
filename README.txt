2.[35pt] Write a script to give me a list of all files in a directory hierarchy sorted by size. This implies that you should give me just the file names, and not the complete path, for all files in the specified directory as well as the subdirectories underneath. If there are any files with size zero, ask the user whether to delete those files (giving relative path name for the file, relative to current directory), and  delete  them  if  the  user  says  yes.  The  script  should  allow  for  directories  to  be  specified  as command line parameters. Use the current directory as default if no directory is specified on the command line. The script should be named flcln.Hint: Iâ€™ll suggest looking for the findcommand and its variousoptions to do this assignment.

3.[40pt] Write a script that will act as a simple calculator for add, subtract, multiply, and divide; each operations should be in a function of its own. Any of the three methods for bash arithmetic, let,expror $((..)),may be used. The user should pass as an argument on the command line a letter (a, s, m or d) and two numbers. The letter will be used to determine which operation will be performed  on  the  two  numbers  entered.  If  one  or  more  of  the  three  parameters  is  leftout,  then display a usage message. Finally display the answers.This script should be called calculator.
